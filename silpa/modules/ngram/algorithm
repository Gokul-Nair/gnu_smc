We have a TREE data structure. Each node in the tree is an instance of NgramNode. 
Each NgramNode objects contains a string value of the node and a Rank
Rank is the incremented frequency of occurance of the corresponding string in the training corpus

NGramNode is a super class of SyllableNgramNode and WordNgramNode
That means, each node in the tree can be either a syllable or a word.
We have only one tree for both words and syllables as of now

In the tree, the root node is an empty node with label *. That indicates that all its childs, either syllables or words,
are start of word or sentence respectively.

Child of a node meaning:
Y is a child ofX means , Y can follow immediately after the occurance of X in the text, Where X,Y are either syllable or word(only one time in  a tree route)
X can have any number of childs.
The probability that a node in the list of childs occur in a given context is controlled by Rank(node)
Rank is nothing but integer values incremented based on frequency of occurance.
Higher the rank, higher the probability that the node can follow immediately after X

Persistance of the populated tree is achieved through pickling the entire tree structure.

Tree operations:
a) Adding a syllable-ngram, n=2
